Components needed for simulation program.

- Room node system (structs?)
   - Room, Door, Outside
   - Connections, Alertness, Actor pool (for door)

- Actor system (structs?)
   - Characteristics
   - Current node, Alert

- Main program
   - Drives simulation (Event scheduling?)
   - Create containers for Nodes and Actors
   - Modular. Allow input scenario program to set up different scenarios. 
   - collects information (data collection within Nodes and Actors?)
       - Total/Average evacuation time
       - Identify bottleneck nodes (compare door pools max size?)
   - generate output file with data

-Scenario programs (or input file? might get complicated for reading in)
   - Sets up actors and environment nodes/connections
   - Alarm delay, starting alert node
   - Fill containers for Nodes and Actors
